# Product Revenue Dashboard
A portfolio project demonstrating SQL querying, DAX measures, data modeling and modern Power BI dashboard desgin. This project walks through the end-to-end BI workflow: from building a SQL dataset to transforming, modeling, visualizing and publishing insights in a clean, polished report    
---
## Project Overview
This project simulates a small product-level revenue dataset.
The goal was to design a **portfolio-ready Power BI dashboard** that highlights essential BI skills:
 - Data extraction from SQL
 - Data transformation + cleaning
 - Creation of calculated metrics (DAX measures)
 - KPI design
 - Interactive slicer
 - Visual Formatting and UX best practices
 - Exporting and publishing deliverables
 ---
 ## Data Structure
 The dataset was created manually through SQL inserts and contains:
 | Field | Description |
 | ----- | ------------|
 |  **Product** | Product name (6 products) |
 |  **Total Revenue** | Dollar revenue generated |
 |  **Total Units Sold** | Number of units sold |
 |  **Avg Revenue per Unit** | Calculated DAX measure |
 ---
 ## DAX Measures Used
 ### **Average Revenue per Unit** 
 '''DAX
 Avg Revenue per Unit = DIVIDE(SUM('product_revenue_analysis'[Total Revenue]), SUM('product_revenue_analysis'[Total Units Sold]))
 Additional aggregation measures were automatically generated by Power BI:
> Sum of Total Revenue
> Sum of Total Units Sold
---
Dashboard Features
1. KPI Cards
 > Total revenue
 > Units Sold
 > Avg Revenue per Unit
 > Clean typography, consistent formatting, no shadows, subtle spacing
2. Slicer
 > Product selector (single-select)
 > Drives all KPIs and charts dynamically
3. Revenue by Product Bar Chart
> Horizontal bar chart with:
 > Value labels turned on
 > Removed gridlines
 > Clean axis formatting
 > Soft border + shadow for contrast
---
UI/UX Design Highlights
> Centered dashboard title using Segoe UI Semibold
> Soft grey theme (#333 for text)
> Clean spacing and alignment using gridlines
> Logical visual heirarchy:
 > KPIs (top-left)
 > Slicer (top-right)
 > Revenue chart (bottom)
> Final report exported to PDF for recruiters/hiring managers
